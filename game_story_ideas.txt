Our poor, misunderstood blob. Let's call her Blobara. All she wanted to do was go home. 

She's not even sure she's on the right planet. Her kind lives on many wet, slimy planets, and this one doesn't seem familiar at all. Even worse, humans seem to be here. And humans and blobs, well, through history, just haven't gotten along. You see, blobs are made of a substance that kills humans on contact. Not very friendly, but hey, biology. 

So our blobby friend. Blobara. She's nice enough. She doesn't mean to be mean. She really doesn't want to hurt anyone at all! But she has to get home, and these humans are in her way! Of course she wants to avoid contact with them, very very much, because, in fact, she really really LIKES humans! But Blobara and her kind are misunderstood because of all those unfortunate deaths that occur every time they meet. 
 
 Blobara also isn't particularly graceful, although she's more agile than most others of her kind. 

 Can you get Blobara home? Can you avoid killing the humans? Oh, there's one more thing: Blobara will probably point this out to you: blobs get very, very hungry. If they don't eat, they shrivel up and will die. But, when they DO eat, they grow. and this makes them even more dangerous. 

 What do they eat? Well, it's unfortunate, but they find human bones delicious. I know, I know, they love humans. They don't want to hurt them. But dead humans, well, those bones sure are super-tasty! Of course they eat other things, too, so don't be afraid to eat other things along the way, but it would probably be quite foolish to miss a nourishing snack of human skeleton.

 Oh, and there's one more thing after that. When blobs are scared or nervous, they split and spawn other bits of blob. These bits will want to follow you, most of the time. But not always. So staying away from humans is super-important. Scare Blobara, and she will create other blobs that are even more likely to kill the humans.
