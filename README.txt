LD33 - THEME: "YOU ARE THE MONSTER"
----------------------------

If you're reading this, hello!

Our poor, misunderstood blob. Let's call her Blobara. All she wanted to do was go home. 

The game as of this writing isn't finished. Between coaching my son through his first 
jam this weekend (he completed the 48hr compo on time!), and a rough start with a shaky 
idea.... well. 

Each level is Blobara trying to get past the humans. She has a growth component, and she 
feeds. She can convert humans into miniblobs she can incorporate into herself. Get too 
large, though, and you won't be able to maneuver through the levels. She has a (what is 
supposed to be a limited) ability to reset her size, too, when you're really in a tight 
spot. 

Oh, and her slimy trail is death to all humans. Watch it. 

Still pondering how to shed other mini-blobs when nervous or frightened or attacked. 

Imagine some sort of feeding on bones for points, while also maybe losing points for 
killing civilians. 

Baby blobs will ecventually grow, I think... You maybe won't control them directly? 
Hoping to keep them following you until a certain "age"/size at which point... I 
don't know. Maybe they move away to go to college or start an acting career.

Any feedback appreciated!  Hit me up at @alexfalkenberg on twitter!

Enjoy!
