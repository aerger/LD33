LD33 - "YOU ARE THE MONSTER"
----------------------------

Placeholder for README.txt

If you're reading this, hello!

Right now the basic idea is that the monster isn't particularly bad, just misunderstood. Not sure how hard I'll push this, nor have I really come up with a setting yet. 

Imagining the monster as some sort of blob that sheds other mini-blobs when nervous or frightened or attacked. Still working on other parts of this. 

Imagine some sort of feeding on bones for points, while also maybe losing points for killing civilians. Not yet sure.

Baby blobs will grow. You won't control them directly? Hoping to keep them following you until a certain "age"/size at which point... I don't know. Maybe they move away to go to college or start an acting career.

Any feedback appreciated over the course of the weekend!  Hit me up at @alexfalkenberg on twitter!

Enjoy!
